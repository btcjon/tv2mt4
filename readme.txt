Rather than have many types of incoming messages, I will ensure incoming messages have the following syntax.
This will make parsing messages more simple and flexible.

I will explicitly map information inside the message with '=' with each information seperated by comma.

Here are definitions:

Common to any:

    type: the type of message.  currently can only be 'update' or 'order'
        example1: type=update 
        example2: type=order
        update: message is only used to update airtable
        order: message is meant to go through our filters and if passes goto pineconnector

    symbol: the symbol
        example1: symbol=EURNZD
        example2: symbol=EURNZD.PRO

Only found in type=update messages

    keyword: let's us know what needs to be updated
        example1: keyword=TD9buyOn 
        example2: keyword=TD9buyOff
        example3: keyword=support
        example4: keyword=resistance
        example5: keyword=up
        example6: keyword=down
    
    tf: time-frame of update
        example1: tf=1H
        example2: tf=30M
        example3: tf=1D

    Examples of incoming type=update messages
        example1: type=update,symbol=EURNZD,keyword=up
        example2: type=update,symbol=EURNZD,keyword=up,tf=1H
        example3: type=update,symbol=USDCAD.PRO,keyword=TD9buyOn,tf=1H    
        example4: type=update,symbol=USDCAD,keyword=support

    Fields in Airtable to update:
    
    Resistance (boolean)
        type=update AND any of the following:
        keyword=resistance (true)
        keyword=resistanceOFF (false)
    
    Support (boolean)
        type=update AND any of the following:
        keyword=support (true)
        keyword=supportOFF (false)
    
    TD9buy (boolean)
        type=update AND any of the following:
        keyword=TD9buy (true)
        keyword=TD9buyOFF (false)
    
    TD9sell (boolean)
        type=update AND any of the following:
        keyword=TD9sell (true)
        keyword=TD9sellOFF (false)
    
    Trend (text)
        type=update AND any of the following:
        keyword=up (change Trend field to 'up')
        keyword=down (change Trend field to 'down')

Only found in type=order messages
    
    order-type: defines the type of order
        example1: order-type=long
        example2: order-type=short
        example3: order-type=closelong
        example4: order-type=closeshort

    risk: defines the risk in an order
        example1: risk=1
        example2: risk=0.3
    
    sl: defines stop loss
        example1: sl=0.1
        example2: sl=0.05
    
    tp: defines take profit
        example1: tp=0.08
        example2: tp=0.1
    
    entry: defines if it is an entry order or not
        example1: entry=true
        example2: entry=false

    comment: defines the order comment
        example1: comment="7-0-30"
    

    Examples of incoming type=order messages
        example1: type=order,order-type=long,symbol=EURNZD.PRO,risk=1,comment="7-0-30",entry=true
        example2: type=order,order-type=closelong,symbol=EURNZD.PRO,comment="7-0-30"
        example3: type=order,order-type=long,symbol=EURNZD.PRO,risk=1,tp=0.08,comment="7-0-30"
        example4: type=order,order-type=long,symbol=EURNZD.PRO,risk=1,tp=0.08,sl=0.1,comment="7-0-30",entry=false

Handling type=order messages:

type=order messages are meant to be sent to pineconnector ONLY if they pass the following conditions:

    entry: indicates whether the order should bypass certain filters
        - If entry=true, the order must pass all active filters as defined in the config.py settings.
        - If entry=false, the order bypasses all filters except for FILTER_TIME and BB_Filter and is sent to PineConnector immediately.

Time Restriction: NONE should ever be sent to pineconnector during this time:
    # Get the current server time
    now = datetime.utcnow().time()

    # Define the start and end of the restricted period in UTC
    start = time(21, 55)  # 9:55 PM UTC
    end = time(23, 0)  # 11:00 PM UTC

    # Check if the current time is within the restricted period
    if start <= now <= end:
        return  # If it is, do not send any commands to PineConnector

BB Restriction: NONE should ever be sent is 'BB' is present in 'State Long'  or 'State Short' fields

    order-type=closelong = send immediately if passes Time Restriction and BB Restriction
        MUST be sent to pineconnector in following format (raw text): ID,closelong,symbol,comment
        Example = 6700960415957,closelong,EURAUD,comment="7-0-30"

    order-type=closeshort = send immediately if passes Time Restriction and BB Restriction
        MUST be sent to pineconnector in following format (raw text): ID,closeshort,symbol,comment
        Example = 6700960415957,closeshort,EURAUD,comment="7-0-30"

    order-type=long: sending rules below...
        1. IF Long# field is greater than '0' send immediately, otherwise respect the following filters,
        2. Trend = up
        3. Resistance = false
        4. TD9sell = false
            MUST be sent to pineconnector in following format (raw text): ID,long,symbol,risk,comment (note tp and sl are optional)
            Example = 6700960415957,long,EURAUD,risk=1,comment="7-0-30" (note tp and sl are optional)
            Example = 6700960415957,long,EURAUD,risk=1,tp=0.07,sl=0.1,comment="7-0-30"
    
    order-type=short: sending rules below...
        1. IF Short# field is greater than '0' send immediately, otherwise respect the following filters,
        2. Trend = down
        3. Support = false
        4. TD9buy = false
            MUST be sent to pineconnector in following format (raw text): ID,short,symbol,risk,comment (note tp and sl are optional)
            Example = 6700960415957,short,EURAUD,risk=1,comment="7-0-30" (note tp and sl are optional)
            Example = 6700960415957,short,EURAUD,risk=1,tp=0.07,sl=0.1,comment="7-0-30"


Updating Airtable fields after type=order message is successfully sent:

State Long
    1. if order-type=long was sent change field to 'open' (if it is not already)
    2. if order-type=closelong was sent change field to 'closed'
State Short
    1. if order-type=short was sent change field to open (if it is not already)
    2. if order-type=closeshort was sent change field to 'closed'
Long#
    1. if order-type=long was sent, increment the number by '1'
    2. if order-type=closelong was sent, change number to '0'
Short#
    1. if order-type=short was sent, increment the number by '1'
    2. if order-type=closeshort was sent, change number to '0'
