As your application grows and you add more incoming messages and rules, it's important to consider maintainability, scalability, and readability of your code. Here are some recommendations to improve the structure of your `app.py` as you continue to expand it:

1. **Use Classes to Encapsulate Logic**: Instead of having loose functions, encapsulate related logic into classes. This will make it easier to manage state and related behaviors.

2. **Implement Design Patterns**: Consider using design patterns such as Command Pattern for operations that you perform on Airtable, and Strategy Pattern for handling different types of messages.

3. **Separate Concerns**: Break down your code into separate modules based on functionality. For example, you could have a module for Airtable interactions, another for message parsing, and another for sending commands to PineConnector.

4. **Use a Message Router**: Implement a message router that can delegate processing of different messages to specific handlers. This will make it easier to add new message types without modifying a central piece of logic.

5. **Externalize Configuration**: Keep your configuration separate from your code. This includes webhook URLs, API keys, and other settings that might change between environments.

6. **Implement Error Handling**: Make sure to have robust error handling and logging in place so that you can easily troubleshoot issues as they arise.

7. **Write Unit Tests**: As you add more functionality, it becomes increasingly important to have a suite of automated tests to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality.

8. **Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data**: Instead of hardcoding sensitive data like API keys in your config files, use environment variables to keep them secure.

9. **Implement Rate Limiting and Retries**: As you interact with external services, make sure to implement rate limiting and retries to handle API limits and transient errors.

10. **Use a Task Queue for Long-Running Tasks**: If any of the webhook processing involves long-running tasks, consider using a task queue like Celery to handle them asynchronously.

11. **Database for State Management**: If you find yourself needing to manage complex state, consider using a database instead of relying on Airtable for everything.

12. **API Versioning**: If you expect the webhook API to change over time, implement versioning so that you can introduce changes without breaking existing integrations.

13. **Documentation**: Keep your API and code well-documented. This will help both you and other developers understand and maintain the system.

14. **Code Reviews**: As you add more features, regular code reviews can help maintain code quality and share knowledge among team members.

15. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment of your application.

These are general recommendations. Depending on the specifics of your application and the rate at which it is growing, some of these suggestions might be more relevant than others. It's also important to refactor incrementally and not all at once to avoid introducing too many changes that could potentially break the application.
